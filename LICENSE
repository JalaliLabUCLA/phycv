PhyCV (Physics-inspired Computer Vision) Library is developed in Jalali Lab at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). These algorithms are spin-offs from the research on photonic time stretch instruments [1] at UCLA. The code was developed by Yiming Zhou, Callen MacPhee, Madhuri Suthar and Dale Capewell.

The source code provided in the repository is for research and evaluation purposes. One of the algorithms PST(Phase Stretch Transform) is the subject of US patent #10,275,891.
